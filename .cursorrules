# Workspace Rules

## Authentication

Access user data on server and client

Server Components:

To use Neon Auth in Next.js server components, import the authServer created in lib/auth/server.ts, and use different API methods it provides.
For quick access to session and user details, you can directly use neonAuth() utility without needing to create authServer.

Client Components:

To use the Neon Auth in Next.js client components, import the authClient created in lib/auth/client.ts, and use different API methods it provides.

## Code Style Guide

- Always use shadcn components for UI
- Always use Tailwind CSS for styling
- after changes run pnpm run lint:types and pnpm run lint:eslint to ensure changes are correct

## Forms

- Always use react-hook-form for form handling
- Use the Form component from @/components/ui/form
- Use drizzle-zod schemas from schema files for form validation
- Import zodResolver from @hookform/resolvers
- Form schemas should be defined in the schema file using createInsertSchema from drizzle-zod

## Types

- for typing the main source of truth would be schema files using drizzle-zod

## Data Access

- for data access always use data files in lib/data
- always use server-only for data access

# Mutations

- for mutations always use actions files in lib/actions
- always use 'use server' directive for actions files
